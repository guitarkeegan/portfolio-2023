            challenges: "Getting the proper scopes and realizing that we needed to reflect that information within our Clerk dashboard to a little time to understand. Getting Prisma, Supabase, and Clerk to all play well together has also been a challenge. Finally, learning the best Classes and methods in the LangChain library to help achieve our goals, has been a tremendous learning experience. Having gone through some of the challenges will certainly help me when faced with similar problems in the future. I remain very motivated, and enjoy working on this project everyday. We are currently pre-seed, and in the process of completing our MVP.",

User authentication and authorization was done with Iron Session. I also used Moralis for interations between our web application and the smart contract.",

Also, it was very difficult for me to decide how we would be getting the game data, as well as what game data I was looking for, having never played League of Ledgends. The Riot Games API has a 24 hour limitation, which added another challenge with testing. The biggest thing I got out of doing this project was getting a sort of wurlwind overview of Chainlink Functions, which had just been released in beta. I was able to deploy the contract before the deadline, but we were not able to deploy the app (was not a requirement). I intend on going back to work on the front end for this app, because I respect the work that Christine put into this project, and want to realize her design.",

            challenges: "I had never created a bot of any kind before this project, so that was fun! I would say the biggest challenge was dealing with the DiscordJS documentation, which seemed to be somewhat fragmented, but in fairness, the folks maintaining the library were in the process of creating a newer version.",

One of the biggest wins for me on the project was to create a working shopping cart feature, were users could add or delete items from a cart, then checkout with Stripe. This was also the first time I ran into the problem of 'prop drilling', or the act of passing props between multiple components. I have since found other solutions to this problem, but it was actually a big win for the groupt at the time.",
